# Project-4-Logistic-Regression-Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression

## Introduction 

Dataset Description
train.csv: A full training dataset with the following attributes:

1.   id: unique id for a news article
2.   title: the title of a news article
3.   author: author of the news article
4.   text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
5.   label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable 

1: Fake News

0: Real News

test.csv: A testing training dataset with all the same attributes at train.csv without the label.

We are going to cover the following steps:

1. Importing Dependencies

## Installation

[No Installation is required to run the code as No UI app is created in this one. The predictive system can run on Google Colaboratory.
Please open the **"Project-4-Logistic-Regression-Fake-News-Detection.ipynb"** file with the help of Google Colaboratory]
